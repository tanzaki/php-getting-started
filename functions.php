The real power of PHP comes from its functions; it has more than 1000 built-in functions.
<h2>Replace Text Within a String</h2>
The PHP str_replace() function replaces some characters with some other characters in a string.

The example below replaces the text "world" with "Dolly":

<div>
	Example
	<?php
	echo str_replace("world", "Dolly", "Hello world!"); // outputs Hello Dolly!
	?>
</div>
