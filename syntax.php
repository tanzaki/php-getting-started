<div>
    Basic PHP Syntax
    A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.

    A PHP script starts with &lt;?php and ends with ?>:

	<?php
	// PHP code goes here
	?>
    The default file extension for PHP files is ".php".

    A PHP file normally contains HTML tags, and some PHP scripting code.

    Below, we have an example of a simple PHP file, with a PHP script that uses a built-in PHP function "echo" to output the text "Hello World!" on a web page:
</div>
<div>
    Comments in PHP
    A comment in PHP code is a line that is not read/executed as part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code.

    Comments can be used to:

    Let others understand what you are doing
    Remind yourself of what you did - Most programmers have experienced coming back to their own work a year or two later and having to re-figure out what they did. Comments can remind you of what you were thinking when you wrote the code
    PHP supports several ways of commenting:

    Example

	<?php
	// This is a single-line comment

	# This is also a single-line comment

	/*
	This is a multiple-lines comment block
	that spans over multiple
	lines
	*/

	// You can also use comments to leave out parts of a code line
	$x = 5 /* + 15 */ + 5;
	echo $x;
	?>
</div>
